This framework is a set of Python scripts, modules, and configuration control files, 
for the processing geodyanmic and plate tectonic data.

The scripts use an input configuration file containing parameter and value pairs.
These paramters determine workflow directives, basic input data,
paths to model output data files, and, links to other resources.

The scripts and modules are self-documenting by running with no arguments.

The scrtipts will generate an example configuration with the optional -e argument.

The modules are self-testing, and different tests may be enabled or disabled.
See each module for details.
