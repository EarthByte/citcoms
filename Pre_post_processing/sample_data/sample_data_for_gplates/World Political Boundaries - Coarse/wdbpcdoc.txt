UNEP/GRID Documentation Summary for Data Set:                                   
World Boundary Databank; PC ARC/INFO 'EXPORT' Version                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
The data file "WDBTEMP4.E00" is based on the "PC World Data Base"               
product from ESRI (April 1990), having been significantly modified              
and enhanced at GRID-Geneva.  Among changes made are the following:             
                                                                                
  -  The "internal" boundaries of former Yugoslavia have been digitized,        
     and the following states have been added: Bosnia-Hercegovina (BS),         
     Croatia (CR) and Slovenia (SS);                                            
                                                                                
  -  The "internal" boundary for Czechoslovakia has been added,                 
     but national entities have not yet been named pending further              
     clarification of the situation there;                                      
                                                                                
  -  The fifteen independent republics of the former USSR (now, the             
     Commonwealth of Independent States or C.I.S.) are upgraded to              
     national status, and have proper country names applied;                    
                                                                                
  -  The boundary between the former East and West Germanies has been           
     removed to form a single country, the Federal Republic of Germany;         
                                                                                
  -  A large number of additional geographic entities have been added           
     through digitization, and/or have had names applied where none             
     were available.  Also, name changes have been made for countries           
     such as 'Burkina' to 'Burkina Faso', 'Burma' to 'Myanmar', etc.            
                                                                                
                                                                                
The data file contains countries as polygons, coastlines, and major lakes       
and islands.  At this time there are no rivers included; they might be          
added as a separate layer in the next version of this data set.                 
                                                                                
Both a polygon attribute table (PAT) and an arc attribute table (AAT)           
exist to define the countries in the coverage "WDBTEMP4".  These tables         
are summarized in the following outlines of their contents.

The INFO look-up table which contained country names in the original ESRI       
version has been included within the Data Classification PAT, as separate       
item 'NAME' up to 40 characters in length, to simplify using these names.       
The projection for this data set remains the same; that is, ARC/INFO's          
Geographic, and coordinates are in latitude/longitude decimal degrees.          
There are a total number of 2801 arcs and 1047 polygons in the data set.        
                                                                                
Those users who are supplied with the data on six-inch magnetic tape will       
find a single ARC/INFO 'EXPORT' file, "WDBTEMP4.E00" to manipulate.  When       
the data are supplied on 3.5" diskettes, users will find a total of four        
diskettes and files ("WDBTEMP4.E00, .E01, .E02 and .E03") to manipulate.        
The data can be 'IMPORTed' using the ARC/INFO command of this name to           
recreate a directory structure and for further manipulation, overlay etc.       
                                                                                
When a tape is delivered, it will first have to be 'TAPEREAD' using the         
ARC/INFO command of this name before the 'IMPORT' can be carried out.           
The tape will normally have been explicitly mounted with a density of           
6250 bpi, with a blocksize of 8000 and a recordsize (record length) of          
80, which yields a blocking factor of 100.                                      
                                                                                
UNEP and GRID wish to express to the users of this product "WDBTEMP4"           
that we take final responsibility for neither the placement of                  
boundaries in this data set, nor for the place names used, but that             
they reflect the best available sources of information available to             
UNEP/GRID at this time.
