Isochron2Ridges
---------------

Isochron2Ridges is a program written in the Python programming language to
convert isochrons to mid-ocean ridges and calculate the total ridge distance
over all isochrons at each age.

To do this it does the following:
 - reads a PLATES4 or GMT format file and extracts isochron features,
 - converts segments of isochrons into mid-ocean ridges and transform faults,
 - calculates the total ridge distance across all isochrons at each age.

Added ability to read GMT format file (in addition to PLATES4 format).
Will automatically detect format of input file and output file will be written in same format.
When reading GMT format the features are expected to have PLATES4 two-line headers embedded in the GMT header (GMT header simply has '>' at beginning of header lines).
If GMT input file doesn't have PLATES4 headers embedded then plate_id information cannot be obtained.
When using Intertec to generate input for Isochron2Ridges use the '-gp' option to embedd PLATES4 headers in GMT output.
GMT format files can contain data points with more than just latitude and longitude - the extra data members are interpolated when used with the --output_extra_ridge_points command-line option.

Fixed some errors with missing global variable declarations, missing "import math" and validateConjugateGroupRidgeDistances() is not in module IsochronFunctions.
Not sure how this was not picked up at previous commit - maybe something to do with the cached ".pyc" files.
----------------------------

Added command-line option to specify maximum sample spacing in Kms (arc distance between two sample points on surface of earth). For example, for a maximum spacing of 100Km you add --output_extra_ridge_points=100 to the command-line.
----------------------------

Replaced simple (lat,lon) strike deviation calculation with more advanced vector calculus - works much better near the poles.
Added PLATES4 'RI' feature code to those considered as isochrons when reading input PLATES4 file.
----------------------------

date: 2008-11-11 20:00:57 +1100;  author: jscannon;  state: Exp;  lines: +94 -286;

Moved common functions out into new 'IsochronFunctions.py' module.
Added '--calculate_fault_distances' command-line flag to calculate transform fault distances instead of mid-ocean ridge distances.
----------------------------

date: 2008-11-11 19:43:56 +1100;  author: jscannon;  state: Exp;  lines: +65 -8;

Added option to read file containing list of plateId/conjugatePlateId pairs whose ridges and faults should be inverted
----------------------------

date: 2008-11-11 19:35:41 +1100;  author: jscannon;  state: Exp;

Initial import of Isochron2Ridges Python program to read isochrons from a PLATES4 format file, convert isochrons to mid-ocean ridges and transform faults and output the total ridge distance across all isochrons at each age.
