gld254.cfg is the "old" style input file used with the pyre version of CitcomS.  Nico sent me this file (15/09/17)

pid8741.cfg is the pid output from the old pyre input

gld254.input is the "new" style input file to use with the C-only version of the code.

Dan created gld254.input by transferring the input parameters from gld254.cfg and pid8741.cfg to the new parameter names and formats.  However, this needs checking, as there might be some parameters/values that I missed.  It's good to use pid8741.cfg as a record of the original input data for the pyre version of the code because the pid file will contain a more complete list of parameters and values (including the defaults used by the code that may not be specified in the cfg file).

Please commit corrections to "gld254.input" as required.
