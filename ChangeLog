	  difference in unusual cases. Also, 'sed' the install-time
	  PYTHONPATH into CitComS scripts (instead of an explicit list of
	  @pythondir@'s). Added _getPrivateDepositoryLocations() and
	  CitcomS.pml. Changed "etc/citcoms" to "etc/CitcomS" for
	  consistency with the Python package name. Add PACKAGE_VERSION to
	  __init__.py, and added pyconfig-generated config.py. Freeze the
	  full path to 'mpirun' and 'mpipython.exe' at 'configure' time.
