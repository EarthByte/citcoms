Installation Instructions
*************************

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system. 

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

     Several optional features are disabled by default. Type
     `./configure --help' to list all available options.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make install' to install the programs and any data
     files and documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.
