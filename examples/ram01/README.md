This example will not run since I have not included the history data.  I can on request, but it was too large to add to the repository.  The point of this example is simply to have documentation of the parameter names in a realistic example that includes lithosphere and slab assimilation, internal velocity boundary conditions, and tracers/composition.

 This example is based on the ram01 model in Bower et al. (2015).
