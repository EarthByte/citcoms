This directory holds sample data files used to develop, test, and debug the various plate tectonic and geodynamic modeling workflows.

Typically this top level directory will hold 
examples of key Citcoms and GPlates data files,
unrelated to a particular model run, 
but useful to test python code.

Specific model directory and file hierarchies, 
mimicking real-world model runs may also be placed here
to develop complex, end-to-end, scripting.
