CitComS.py NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.  2006-11-27

Please send CitComS.py bug reports to cig-mc@geodynamics.org.


Version 2.1.0

* A new input parameter "datadir" specifies the path of output files. The
  "datafile" input parameter (cannot contain path) specifies the filename
  prefix of the output files. In v2.0.x and before, "datafile" is used to
  specify the path and filename prefix of output files. This change is not
  backward compatible. Users need to change their old input file to run it.

* Imporved build procedure. The CitComS executable embeds python
  interpreter by default and is staticly linked with MPI library,
  which improves the portability of the code. 

* New input format (INI-styled .cfg)

* No need to specify launcher.nodes anymore, it is calculated from the mesher
  properties.

* Support of binary format output (using HDF5 library).

* Additional data output (including: geoid, stress, pressure, and horizontal
  average) can be enabled/disabled by changing the input parameters.

* Scripts (using GMT commands) to plot 2-D cross sections of temperature field.

* Added/removed a few input parameters (all in solver.const component) for
  computing geoid. Removed "layerd" and "wdensity" and added "radius", 
  "density_above" and "density_below".

* Fixes for several bugs: issue 30, 35, 42, 44 and 55. See the Geodynamics
  Roundup issue tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) and the file
  ChangeLog for details. Important bug fixes include:

  - Inconsistent times in C and Pyre. When 'fixed_timestep' is set
    and the grid resolution is insufficient, the Pyre part of CitComS
    could give the wrong model time. (Issue 35)

  - Accidental deletion of surf files by batchsurf.py. batchsurf.py is a script
    to combine the surf files. If the current working directory happens to be
    the output directory of CitcomS, the script would delete the original surf
    files. (Issue 55)


Version 2.0.2

* Fixes for several minor bugs: issues 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
  Most of these are installation-related.  See the Geodynamics Roundup
  issue tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) and the file ChangeLog
  for details.
