INSTALL
-------

This new version of CitcomS only requires a valid MPI distribution (no more python / pyre).  Most
clusters can load an MPI distribute using 'modules'

e.g., in Bern I use:

module load openmpi/1.10.2-intel

For reasons relating to compilers, the cluster and node setup, some mpi versions may be
preferred for your particular cluster.  I was recommended by the Bern sys admin to use the
intel compiler with openmpi.  You might also want to find out which openmpi is preferred
on your cluster (and perhaps add this above, so we have complete documentation of what works
and what doesn't).

Then, to install CitcomS v3.1.1 with data assimilation go into the src/ directory and execute

./mymake.py

[Yes OK, for the step above you do need a python distribution, but this is only to
 run the commands that configure and make Citcoms.  Python is not actually used for
 running the code]

Example input and output configuration files are provided in inputeg/

This example is a good one to try and run first: src/examples/Full

You will need to setup your job submission script.  See a slurm example in jobsubmit/  Please add your
own submission scripts to the same directory so we have more examples

Dan's work in progress below here
---------------------------------

Rakib's code - sent to me by Sabin (12/09/17) CitcomSModDtopoRelease_Rakib.zip

Differences with Rakib
None of these changes have been implemented in the new code yet
----------------------

Advection_diffusion.c
  -- scaled visc and adiabatic heating by Di
     I gave him this code originally, so can include it
convection_variables.h
  -- blob_profile, silo parameters, mantle_temp_adiabatic_increase
global_defs.h
  -- Shell-output facility
Initial_temperature.c
  -- bunch of silo / blob related functions
     evidentally seeding plumes for the IC
Material_properties.c
  -- refstate updates.  I gave him this code so have it (notably Di depth dependent)
Output.c
  -- outputs of shells (theta, phi, r, temperature, vr)
Output_vtk.c
  -- perhaps not related to Rakib's work
Viscosity_structures.c
  -- some new viscosity structures (case 112, 113, 117, 118)
     these should be straightforward to merge in


New code features so far
------------------------

Implemented:
  -- slab and lithosphere assimilation (grep for 'DJB SLAB')
        lith_age_depth_function
        lith_age_exponent
        lith_age_min
        lith_age_stencil_value
        slab_assim
        slab_assim_file
        sten_temp output
  -- composition (grep for 'DJB COMP')
        hybrid_method
        increased memory for tracer arrays
  -- viscosity formulations (grep for 'DJB VISC')
        many of these relate to viscosity structures for data assimilation work
        see Viscosity_structures.c
            (1) case 20, used in Flament et al. (2013, 2014)
            (2) case 21, used in Flament et al. (2014), model TC8
            (3) case 22, used in Flament et al. (2014), model TC7
            (4) case 23, used in Flament et al. (2014), model TC9
            (5) case 24, used in Zhang et al. (2010) and Bower et al. (2013)

Not implemented (yet):
  -- internal velocity bcs (I don't think these are used by anyone anyway)
  -- outputs of heating terms, divv
  -- tracer density for elements and nodes output (added by Ting, see svn r52 through r55)
  -- buoyancy restart for dynamic topography (exclude buoyancy) (see svn r85)
  -- time exit routine (added by Ting, see svn r57)
  -- composition and temperature spherical harmonics
  -- anything from Rakib
  -- reverse gravity acceleraton (added by Ting, see svn r76) for SBI
