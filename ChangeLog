	* mc/3D/CitcomS/trunk/configure.ac: Push/pop C++ around MPI tests,
	  which are now sensitive to the current language. Made sure that
	  '--without-pyre' works in the absence of a C++ compiler (tested
	  on Hrothgar). When building with Pyre modules, fail if a C++
	  compiler is not found.

	  environment, which might make a difference in unusual cases.

	  (instead of an explicit list of @pythondir@'s). Added
	  _getPrivateDepositoryLocations() and CitcomS.pml. Changed
	  "etc/citcoms" to "etc/CitcomS" for consistency with the Python
	  package name. Add PACKAGE_VERSION to __init__.py, and added
	  pyconfig-generated config.py. Freeze the full path to 'mpirun'
	  and 'mpipython.exe' at 'configure' time. First crack at batch
	  system configuration.

	  "../tests/citcomsregional.sh"); and so that the 'visual'
	  directory doesn't have to be added to the PATH. I also
	  dusted-off 'array2d' -- it compiles and links now.
