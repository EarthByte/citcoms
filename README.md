# CitcomS with Data Assimilation

## Installation

This version of CitcomS only requires a valid MPI distribution (no more python / pyre).  Most clusters can load an MPI distribute using modules

e.g., in Bern I use:

```module load openmpi/1.10.2-intel```

For reasons relating to compilers, the cluster and node setup, some mpi versions may be preferred for your particular cluster.  I was recommended by the Bern sys admin to use the intel compiler with openmpi.  You might also want to find out which openmpi is preferred on your cluster (and perhaps add this above, so we have complete documentation of what works and what doesn't).

Then, to install CitcomS v3.1.1 with data assimilation go into the src/ directory and execute

```./mymake.py```

[Yes OK, for the step above you do need a python distribution, but this is only to run the commands that configure and make Citcoms.  Python is not actually used for running the code]

Example input and output configuration files are provided in inputeg/

This example is a good one to try and run first: src/examples/Full

You will need to setup your job submission script.  See a slurm example in jobsubmit/  Please add your own submission scripts to the same directory so we have more examples

### Rakib's code

Sent to me by Sabin (12/09/17) CitcomSModDtopoRelease\_Rakib.zip
See diff/ directory for complete record
None of these changes have been implemented in the new code yet

1. Advection\_diffusion.c
  * Scaled visc and adiabatic heating by Di.
  * I gave him this code originally, so can include it.
2. convection\_variables.h
  * blob\_profile
  * silo parameters
  * mantle\_temp\_adiabatic\_increase
3. global\_defs.h
  * Shell-output facility
4. Initial\_temperature.c
  * bunch of silo / blob related functions  
  * evidentally seeding plumes for the IC
5. Material\_properties.c
  * refstate updates.
  * I gave him this code so have it (notably Di depth dependent)
6. Output.c
  * outputs of shells (theta, phi, r, temperature, vr)
7. Output\_vtk.c
  * perhaps not related to Rakib's work
8. Viscosity\_structures.c
  * some new viscosity structures (case 112, 113, 117, 118)  
  * these should be straightforward to merge in

#### Output time (grep for 'DJB TIME')
1. output time modification [NOT IMPLEMENTED, ONLY PLACEHOLDERS]

### Code features NOT implemented

1. internal velocity bcs (I don't think these are used by anyone anyway)
2. outputs of heating terms, divv
3. tracer density for elements and nodes output (added by Ting, see svn r52 through r55)
4. buoyancy restart for dynamic topography (exclude buoyancy) (see svn r85)
5. time exit routine (added by Ting, see svn r57)
6. composition and temperature spherical harmonics
7. anything from Rakib (see Rakib's code in above section)
8. reverse gravity acceleraton (added by Ting, see svn r76) for SBI
9. turn off itracer_warnings
